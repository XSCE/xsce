In the open terminal type: sudo xsceinst

Proceed through the guided prompts

Click partitioning and then click on "done"
If you're booting uefi I would not rely on the automatic partitioning to be accurate yet, select custom and handle that part personally for now.

Click on "begin installation"

After the install click the complete button and use "poweroff" in the terminal

Notes:
Should you want to create another user please do not use "xsce-admin" as a new user, that one is already occupied.
Please refrain from using liveinst during testing, tring to implement that functionality in the future, but if you're brave try "xsceinst" at the bootprompt.

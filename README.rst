=====================
Dextrose server (DXS)
=====================

Welcome to the git repository of the Dextrose Server project, implementing
Activity Central's vision of a School Server appliance with enterprise
support. DXS closely tracks the XSCE_ (School Server Community Edition),
both in vision and software development.

All of our server code resides in this repository. We are using ansible_ as
the underlying technology to install, deploy, configure and manage the
various server components.

Please see the *INSTALL* file from the *docs* folder for instructions to install the server on
supported software and hardware platforms.

If you want to explore and get dirty with the code, please read the HACKING
file. You would probably want to go through the `ansible documentation`_
before diving into the playbooks. Documentation for creating plugins for the
server is under construction.

Source code is available in this `Github repository`_.

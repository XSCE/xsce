<p><strong>What's New?</strong> * On the rpi2 and rpi3, XSCE now runs on the Raspbian operating system that has mainstream support from the Raspberry Pi Foundation. * This release adds support for the Debian Operating system, often preferred in commercial hosting environments, for its stability, and long term support. * The reorganization of the XSCE codebase permits ongoing support for Centos, and legacy support for OLPC's XO laptops. (Support will end for Fedora, other than for XOs, due to the 6 month release cycle, and corollary support issues.)</p>
<p><strong>What's Upgraded?</strong> * Sugarizer -- Bumped from 0.8 to 0.9, brings One Laptop per Child activities to laptops and smartphones.</p>

<h1 id="release-notes-for-release-6.2">Release Notes for Release 6.2</h1>
<p><strong>What's New?</strong> * On the rpi2 and rpi3, XSCE now runs on the Raspbian operating system that has mainstream support from the Raspberry Pi Foundation. * This release adds support for the Debian Operating system, often preferred in commercial hosting environments, for its stability, and long term support. * The reorganization of the XSCE codebase permits ongoing support for Centos, and legacy support for OLPC's XO laptops. (Support will end for Fedora, other than for XOs, due to the 6 month release cycle, and corollary support issues.)</p>
<p><strong>What's Upgraded?</strong> * Sugarizer -- Bumped from 0.8 to 0.9, brings One Laptop per Child activities to laptops and smartphones. * Kiwix server has sometime been unreliable on the rpi. Add hourly wakeup. * Use of a USB drive (jump stick) has been simplified for quickly adding content to the server. * Access to the server by typing its name into a browser is shortened from http://schoolserver.lan to Http://box.</p>

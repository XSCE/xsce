<h2 id="what-is-configuration">What is Configuration?</h2>
<p>Building a server requires a number of steps, and there is usually some configuration required at each step. 1. Choice of Operating System, keyboard layout, disk format, and partitioning. IIAB has <a href="./XSCE-Platforms#disk-partitioning.html">parititoning requirements.</a> 2. IIAB takes over after the operating system is functioning on the target hardware. This step is usually done at a terminal console or via a ssh remote connection to the newly installed OS. (If all the requirements are in place, this step can be as simple as typing &quot;./runansible&quot;).</p>
<p>There is some automatic configuration built into IIAB, during this text mode phase. There will almost always be a network connection to the internet left over from the first step. If a second ethernet or wifi adapter is discovered, Gateway mode will be chosen. If not, the mode selected will be &quot;Appliance&quot;. See the discussion of <a href="./XSCE-Networking-Overview#xsce-networking-overview.html">server modes.</a></p>
<p>There is also the option of setting a large array of variables that govern the detailed installation process. In most cases, the supplied defaults will be sufficient. Any changes to defaults should be placed in ./vars/local_vars.yml (See details of <a href="#variable-precedence">variable precedence</a> below). 3. The Administrative Console is the Graphical User Interface for making most configuration changes. There is a HELP system built into the Administrative Console (Linked here): 1. <a href="../Utilities.rst.html">Utilities.</a></p>
<p>By default, most software required by the XSCE server is installed during the text mode (step #2), but not enabled. Then the enabling of services, and loading of content is done during step #3.</p>
<h3 id="detailed-description-of-ansible-control-variables">Detailed Description of Ansible control variables</h3>
<p>The ./vars/default_vars.yml is the first place to look for variables that might control the install process. But the place to make any changes is in ./vars/local_vars.yml. Any variable assignments you make in local_vars.yml will override values in ./vars/default_vars.yml</p>
<p>In general, there is a <code>&lt;role name&gt;_install</code> and a <code>&lt;role name&gt;_enabled</code> variable for each role. (The roles can be found in the directories under /opt/schoolserver/xsce/roles/). For most roles, during the text mode install phase, the install variable is set to <code>True</code>, and the enabled variable is set to <code>False</code>.</p>
<h4 id="variable-precedence">Variable Precedence</h4>
<p>There is a hierarchy of places to define variables in ansible (progressing from lowest to highest priority):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The setup module explores hardware, and defines a large number of variables. All of these have the prefix: &quot;ansible_&quot;.</li>
<li>Variables can be defaulted in each role by the existence of a <code>&lt;role name&gt;/defaults/main.yml</code> file.</li>
<li>At the root of the repo, there is a <code>./vars/default_vars.yml</code> which gives initial values for repo wide settings, and also many role specific ones. <strong>Note:</strong> this file may be overwritten by later releases, and should not be modified by the end user.</li>
<li>End user changes should be made in <code>./vars/local_vars.yml</code> using a text editor such as vi, nano, or emacs.</li>
<li>Changes made in the graphical console, at <code>&lt;server host name&gt;/admin</code>, take precedence ahead of all the above.</li>
</ol>

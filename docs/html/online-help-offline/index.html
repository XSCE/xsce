<p>The best place to start is <a href="./IIAB-Installation.html">IIAB Installation</a> which has detailed information on installing the server in several different ways.</p>
<p>You can also read about <a href="./IIAB-Architecture.html">IIAB Architecture</a>.</p>
<p>See <a href="./IIAB-Platforms.html">IIAB Platforms</a> for platform specific information on the operating system and <strong>partitioning scheme</strong>.</p>
<p>After installation, the Admin Console provides tools for selecting and downloading content. After that is done, the user will probably want to provide a <a href="./IIAB-Menuing.html">menu or portal</a> page for direct access to the selected content.</p>
<p><a href="./IIAB-Networking.html">IIAB Networking</a> overviews common network setups/topologies and TCP/UDP ports.</p>
<p>N.B.: Internet-in-a-Box was formerly known as the OLPC <a href="http://schoolserver.org">School Server Community Edition</a> (XSCE).</p>
<p>See our <a href="http://../FAQ">FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</a> for more answers arising from our http://IIAB.io forums, towards building your very own powerful digital library!</p>

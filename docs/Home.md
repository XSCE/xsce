## Welcome to the Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB/XSCE) Wiki!

The best place to start is [IIAB Installation](https://github.com/XSCE/xsce/wiki/IIAB-Installation) which has detailed information on installing the server in several different ways.

You can also read about [IIAB Architecture](https://github.com/XSCE/xsce/wiki/IIAB-Architecture).

See [IIAB Platforms](https://github.com/XSCE/xsce/wiki/IIAB-Platforms) for platform specific information on the operating system and **partitioning scheme**.

After installation, the Admin Console provides tools for selecting and downloading content. After that is done, the user will probably want to provide a [menu or portal](https://github.com/XSCE/xsce/wiki/IIAB-Menuing) page for direct access to the selected content.

[IIAB Networking](https://github.com/XSCE/xsce/wiki/IIAB-Networking) overviews common network setups/topologies and TCP/UDP ports.

N.B.: Internet-in-a-Box was formerly known as the OLPC [School Server Community Edition](http://schoolserver.org) (XSCE).

See our [FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)](http://schoolserver.org/faq) for more answers arising from our http://IIAB.io forums, towards building your very own powerful digital library!

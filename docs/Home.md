## Welcome to the xsce wiki!

The best place to start is [XSCE Installation](https://github.com/XSCE/xsce/wiki/XSCE-Installation) which has detailed information on installing the server by several different means.

After installation, the next step is [XSCE Configuration.](https://github.com/XSCE/xsce/wiki/XSCE-Config)

The Administrative Console provides tools for selecting and downloading content. After that is done, the user will probably want to provide a [menu or portal](https://github.com/XSCE/xsce/wiki/XSCE-Menuing) page for direct access to the selected content.

See [XSCE Platforms](https://github.com/XSCE/xsce/wiki/XSCE-Platforms) for platform specific information on the operating system and **partitioning scheme**.

[XSCE Networking Overview](https://github.com/XSCE/xsce/wiki/XSCE-Networking-Overview) provides the specifics of network setup including ports open.

There is a collection of Frequently Asked Questions at [schoolserver.org/faq](http:schoolserver.org/faq)

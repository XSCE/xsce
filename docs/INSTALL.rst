On the XO-1.75 or XO-4 laptop
=============================

* Flash the laptop with a stable `13.2.0 image`_

* In ``My Settings->Power`` turn off Automatic Power Management

* Install git and ansible (for dependencies)::

    su -
    yum install -y git ansible
    
  **Note**: ansible version 1.4.1 or higher is required. If your installed
  version is previous you can install it from sources using::

    cd ~/
    git clone https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git
    cd ansible
    git checkout release1.4.1
    python setup.py install

* Clone the XSCE git repo and cd into it::

    cd ~/
    git clone https://github.com/XSCE/xsce
    cd xsce

* Connect any and all network interfaces

* Optional - verify that network interfaces are properly autodetected.  If they aren't, reboot the target machine and check again::

    sh roles/common/library/xsce_facts

* From the xsce directory, run initial setup.  The XO will automatically reboot upon completion::

    ./runansible

* After rebooting::

    cd xsce/
    ./runansible # This will take a lot of time as it installs packages
    reboot

* XSCE should be up and functional

Using tags
==========

* To avoid replaying all the playbooks, you can use tags to restrict which tasks are run: 
::

  ansible-playbook -i ansible_hosts xsce.yml --tags="facts,squid" --connection=local
* Avaliable tags are:``activity-server, addons, ajenti, avahi, common, core, dhcpd, download, ejabberd, facts, gateway, httpd, idmgr, iiab, monit, moodle, munin, named, network, olpc, pathagar, portal, postgresql, services, squid, sugar-stats, wondershaper, xo``


Building the rpm
================

An rpm can be built by using the command::

    rpmbuild -bb dxs.spec

==============================
Installing the Dextrose Server
==============================

Like the XSCE_, both single and two dongle installs are supported. Performing
the two dongle install requires a bit of manual configuration which we will
get to.


On the XO-1.75 or XO-4 laptop
=============================

* Flash the laptop with a stable `13.2.0 image`_

* In ``My Settings->Power`` turn of Automatic Power Management

* Install ansible and git::

    su -
    wget http://xsce.activitycentral.com/repos/xs-extra/noarch/ansible-1.3.1-0.git201309161027.fc18.noarch.rpm
    yum -y localinstall ansible-1.3.1-0.git201309161027.fc18.noarch.rpm
    yum -y install git

* Clone the DXS git repo and run initial setup::

    cd ~/
    git clone https://github.com/activitycentral/dxs.git
    cd dxs
    ./runansible

.. Warning::
   Depending on the type of setup (one or two dongle), you'll need to
   check and edit the contents of
   ``<dxs_root_directory>/vars/default_vars.yml``. For a one dongle
   setup the interfaces are eth0 and eth1 for WAN and LAN respectively.
   For a two dongle setup, the interfaces become eth1 and eth2. Since
   DXS won't automatically find out which eth is LAN or WAN, a good
   practice would be to first insert the WAN dongle, so it get's its IP
   address, and then insert the LAN dongle.

* After rebooting (insert the ethernet dongles at this point)::

    cd dxs
    ./runansible # This will take a lot of time as it installs packages
    reboot

* DXS should be up and functional

Building the rpm
================

An rpm can be built by using the command::

    rpmbuild -bb dxs.spec

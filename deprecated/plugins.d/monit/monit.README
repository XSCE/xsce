Monit is a helpful program that automatically monitors services to ensure that they remain online. Monit also monitors memory or cpu usage.

Services being monitored are listed at /etc/monit.d , and to avoid interlocking, if a service is restarted more than 3 times within 5 cycles , monit will forgot about it.

To tell monit to stop monitoring a service, run "monit stop <servicename>"

Services currently running can be checked a few minutes after boot, by running "monit summary". This few minutes works as grace period, because some services may take some time to start.a

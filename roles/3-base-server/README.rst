==================
Base Server README
==================

This role is a place to aggregate roles that are required to create a basic web server.
The functionality here is not packages that are not directly consumed by users, which are in common,
nor specific applications, such as those found in the apps and tools roles.

The difference between this aggregate and server-options is that the roles here are required.

Eventually a graphical configuration console will be added here.

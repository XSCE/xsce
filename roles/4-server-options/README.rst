Server Options README
=====================

This role is a place to aggregate roles that may be optionally added to the basic server,
whereas the roles in base-server are required. As in the case of the base-server the
functionality here is not packages that are not directly consumed by users, which are in common,
nor specific applications, such as those found in the apps and tools roles.

Portal readme
=============

This portal is meant to be shown when accessing the server from any device
in the network.
The list of available services is read from the services.json file, which
is build by Ansible using a service file list.
The portal should be kept to the best extent responsive, to allow easier
usage from diverse client devices, and simple, for lighter operation.

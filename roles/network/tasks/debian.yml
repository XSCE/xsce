# debian.yml
# Start out making simplifying assumptions 
#   1. we are dealing with a rpi3
#   2. Gui inputs define the config -- auto config is more difficult
#      a. gui_desired_network_role
#      b. hostapd_enabled
#      c. gui_static_wan_ip 
#   3. In appliance mode: wan (and wlan0) is either static or dhcp under br0, and hostapd off
#   4. In lan_controller: wan is off, eth0 and wlan0 under br0
#   5. In gateway: eth0 is wan, and wlan0 is under br0 (only one adapter under br0)
#   6. As a slight concess to auto config, if eth1 exists, make it wan, and force gateway

XSCE Admin Console - Overview
=============================

The purpose of this Admin Console is to assist an administrator in configuring, adding content to, and generally managing
the School Server.

### Caution

The Admin Console you are using can make changes to the server.  These changes can take varying amounts of time to complete
and the Console will often not be aware of exactly when they finish.  To see the results of these changes in the Admin Console
panels you will need to refresh your browser.

The Admin Console is also not aware of hardware changes you make, like plugging in an ethernet cable, until you reboot, so you
should reboot when you make such changes.

The following menu options are available.  Please see the help for each individually.

Publicly Available Windows Storage
==================================
The school server will advertise a shared "public" folder available to all windows machines.

The permissions are set as follows:
- Users may read and write to the "public" shared folder.
- The are forced to store their files as a user who has no ability to log on to the server.
- The user, with no ability to log on, has a password which is very difficult to guess "verylong%and$hard^to@guess"
